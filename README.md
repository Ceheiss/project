#### Description:

DojoScrolls is an application made for martial artists. The idea comes from my own experience. Around three years ago, I started tracking my martial arts training sessions to get a clearer picture of how much time I was spending on the mats. I stored information like the date, session number (like an ID), the discipline, and a description of what we did. This often included how I felt, how sparring went, what techniques we learned, and so on.

Having logged well over 200 sessions, I accumulated a lot of data, but I thought it would be awesome to have some metrics to go with it. That is how the idea for this application was born.

As a user, you can register with DojoScrolls and start logging your training sessions. When you log in, you will be greeted with a dashboard displaying relevant data about your training, such as the total number of logged sessions, average feeling (each session records how you felt on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being great), charts showing sessions per month, the frequency of techniques learned, and the different disciplines trained.

Where does the information come from? From your notes. For each training session, you can save it through a form. In the form, you must add the discipline trained, the techniques (comma-separated) practiced, how you felt, and insights (a timestamp is added automatically on the backend).

You can view all your notes, click to see details (text is truncated in the general display), and edit or delete them (providing full CRUD functionality).

### Technical Aspects

The application consists of two main parts: the backend and the frontend.

The backend code is written in `Python` using `Flask`. Instead of using `Jinja`, I chose to make my application an API to be consumed by a separate frontend (to simulate two independent teams working on the application). Each route returns data in JSON format.

I used `Sqlite3` as the database and utilized the CS50 library to interact with it, just like in the Finance problem set. The data is structured in two main tables: one for users and one for notes (with `user_id` as a foreign key in the notes table).

The frontend is built with `Next.js`, which uses `React`. This decision was mainly pedagogical because I could have written the API directly in Next.js or used Jinja for the frontend. However, I wanted to work with two different technologies. I used Next.js middleware to handle route permissions based on whether the user is logged in, so there was some server-side code, but mostly I used Next.js to create and route the UI effectively.

I decided not to use `ContextAPI`, Redux, or any other state management tool. Instead, almost every component queries its own data. In some edge cases (like the Navbar buttons needing to know if a user is logged in), I used HTML `CustomEvents`, which was a fun, new approach for me (because I was determined not to share state).

Hereâ€™s an example:

```tsx
const authChange = new CustomEvent("authChange", {
  detail: { isLogged: true },
});
window.dispatchEvent(authChange);
```
For the dashboard, I used `chart.js`, which provided a simple way to generate the visual components I was looking for. I decided against diving into D3 for data visualization, as it felt too complex for my purposes.

Although Tailwind was included in the initial setup, I used plain CSS but kept Tailwind for potential future use.

### Running The Application

To run the application, navigate to the `api` folder and create a virtual environment:
`python3 -m venv venv``

Activate it:
`source venv/bin/activate`

Install the requirements:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run the backend:
`python3 app.py`

The backend will run on port 5000.

For the frontend, navigate to the `frontend` folder and install dependencies:
`npm run install`

Create a `.env.local` file at the root level and add the API URL. For example:
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000`

Finally run the app in development mode:
`npm run dev``

ou can now go to `http://localhost:3000/register`, create a user, and start your journey!

### Further Details

The frontend uses tools like TypeScript, Lint, and Prettier for formatting. I also have a simple `todo.txt` file at the root level with future tasks and improvements.

As both the developer and a user of my application, I plan to keep improving it and eventually deploy it. For now, running it locally is sufficient.
