Simple list for features or next development steps:

Frontend:
- Implement context so the navbar knows always if user is logged in or not.
- Use middleware (maybe) so users can only go to certain permitted route based on auth.
- Have a separate layout on the dashboard (a welcoming one for unlogged/unregistered, and some stats
based on queries to define with visualization)
***** Not priority ******
- Add decent logo and thumbnail
- Make forms and other things look good, or at least decent

API:
- Think of routes and queries to DB that can be helpful for the dashboard.

Extras:
- Will I add something with C? Is it possible?
