Simple list for features or next development steps:

Frontend:
[x] Implement context so the navbar knows always if user is logged in or not.
[x] Use middleware (maybe) so users can only go to certain permitted route based on auth.
[x] Create UI to generate a new note
[x] Create UI to delete a note
[x] Create UI to edit note
[ ] Have a separate layout on the dashboard (a welcoming one for unlogged/unregistered, and some stats
based on queries to define with visualization)
***** Not priority ******
[ ] Add decent logo and thumbnail
[ ] Make forms and other things look good, or at least decent

API:
[x] Create route to add a new note to the list
[x] Create route to delete note
[x] Create route and logic to edit note
[ ] Think of routes and queries to DB that can be helpful for the dashboard.

Extras:
[ ] Will I add something with C? Is it possible?
[ ] Add pagination for notes and different ways to filter them
